# Azure Hands-on Lab - Data Science Project

Experience data engineering with Flight delay data sets

## 1. Create Azure Data Facotry 

Create ADF to move flight data from blob to ADLS gen 2
Use Copy Data tool to build data pipeline for the first time
Use binary copy

## 2. Access Flight Data

Create Azure Databricks and import notebooks (Python)
```

```

### 2.1 Mount ADLS gen 2

### 2.2 Import Data

## 3. Feature Engineering

### 3.1 Feature Engineering

Understand how to transform data

### 3.1 Feature Engineering (Continue)

## 4. Create Training Datasets

## 5. Model Training and Deployment

### 5.1 Model Selection

Install Azure Machine Learning Service SDK for Python on Azure Databricks

### 5.2 Deploy Model

Register Models and deploy the model on ACI

## 6. Model Management and Deployment using Azure Machine Learning Service
